                <h3>ARAM UPDATES</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="text-section">
                <div class="text-section-container">
                    <p class="text-frumos-2"> This update goes out to our ARAM players! From the new stat adjustments introduced in the last patch to falling towers and Frostgates, new and exciting updates are coming to the Howling Abyss this patch.</p>
                    <p class="text-frumos-2">A lot of the fun in ARAM happens when you're fighting, poking, or womboing your opponents—not when you're walking back to the fight. To help you get back into the action faster we're introducing Hexgates to the Howling Abyss!
                        Frostgates will be present from the beginning of the game and will teleport you directly from your Nexus to your outer tower. Once your first tower is destroyed, the Frostgate will then link to your team’s inhibitor tower where it will then stay for the remainder of the game.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-frumos-2">Some parts of the bridge have been showing their age recently and are starting to fall apart. Our goal with falling towers is to create more interesting situations on the map that break away from the usual straight line of ARAM. Now you’ll have new choke points to think about, Fog of War to hide in, and terrain you can experiment with to create new plays!
                        Tower Rubble: When outer towers are destroyed they will collapse and leave behind a pile of rubble which will be treated as new terrain.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-frumos-2">Alongside the ARAM changes we figured we'd also do some landscaping on the bridge to help freshen things up a bit. 
                        Brushing Up: There is now one new brush in the middle bottom side of the bridge. The brushes between the outer and inhibitor turrets have also increased in size.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-frumos-2">
                        We finally got around to making some repairs on Howling Abyss! With the new falling towers mechanic we wanted to make the bridge a bit more spacious to compensate for the space now taken up by tower rubble.
                        Under Repair: The gaps on the bottom side of the bridge have been filled in and are now traversable
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-frumos-2">Adding a few quality of life updates to the current Battle Boost feature.
                        Not so Fast: Players will no longer be able to activate Battle Boosts within the last 10 seconds of champion select
                        You’re Welcome: Allies will now be able to tell which player gifted their team a Battle Boost

                        We want it to be easy to get to the fun of League without having to do a ton of research beforehand. So like we added item recommendations to the shop, we’re also adding a rune recommender in champion select! You can access it by hovering or locking in a champion and clicking the new icon next to the edit rune page button. We have a few more planned additions for this feature and will be keeping an eye on your feedback to improve it over the next few patches! 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-frumos-2">Added the Rune Recommender to champion select for all game modes. These recommendations are tailored for your champion, position, and come with optional summoner spell recommendations as well. Like in-game item recommendations, these will be updated each patch.</p>
                    <p class="text-frumos-2">All players have a free temporary rune page that the recommender will overwrite in each champion select. To permanently save a recommendation to your collection, you can add it in the post match screen.</p>
                    <p class="text-frumos-2">The 5 preset rune pages have been removed.</p>

                <p class="text-frumos-2">Draft strategy is an important part of the game in queues that support drafting, so we want to make it easy for your team to optimize its draft for success. Currently there are a lot of opportunities for things to go wrong for players trying to swap their pick order — you have to communicate in chat with the person you want to swap with, have the champion that the other player wants, and then successfully trade champions before the game starts, all while preparing your rune and summoner loadouts. We’ll be streamlining this process by letting you swap pick order with the press of a button!</p>
                <p class="text-frumos-2">In matchmade queues with drafting, during the declaration, ban, and pick phases, you can now press a button next to ally portraits to swap pick order with them. When there is 5 seconds left in a phase, in-progress order swap requests will be canceled. If your order swap request is declined, you cannot initiate another request with that player.</p>
                <p class="text-frumos-2">Champion swapping during the preparation phase is now initiated by clicking on the allied champion’s portrait instead of a button next to the portrait.</p>
                <p class="text-frumos-2">Miscellaneous champion select font and text changes for consistency.</p>

                <p class="text-frumos-2">We’ve heard feedback that with the only difference between ally’s names in champion select being the numbers 1 through 5, it can be difficult to tell who’s speaking, particularly when a lot of people are talking at the same time. So now you all get code names!
                
                </p>
                <p class="text-frumos-2">Ally 1 -> Ally 5 have been renamed to Gromp, Murk Wolf, Raptor, Krug, and Scuttle Crab for improved clarity around who is speaking in champion select chat.</p>
